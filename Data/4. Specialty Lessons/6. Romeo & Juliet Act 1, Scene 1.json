[Prologue I]
Two households, both alike in dignity,\r\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\r\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\r\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\r\nFrom forth the fatal loins of these two foes\r\nA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;\r\nWhose misadventured piteous overthrows

[Prologue II]
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.\r\nThe fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,\r\nAnd the continuance of their parents' rage,\r\nWhich, but their children's end, nought could\r\nremove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our\r\nstage; The which if you with patient ears attend,\r\nWhat here shall miss, our toil shall strive to\r\nmend.

[Act 1, Scene 1]
SAMPSON\r\nGregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.\r\nGREGORY\r\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nI mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.\r\nGREGORY\r\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o' the\r\ncollar.

[I Don't Trust These Guys.]
SAMPSON\r\nI strike quickly, being moved.\r\nGREGORY\r\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.

[Can you believe this guy?]
GREGORY\r\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:\r\ntherefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will\r\ntake the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

[This Could Get Ugly Fast.]
GREGORY\r\nThat shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes\r\nto the wall.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nTrue; and therefore women, being the weaker\r\nvessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I\r\nwill push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust\r\nhis maids to the wall.

[Lots of Drama On the Horizon.]
GREGORY\r\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their\r\nmen.\r\nSAMPSON\r\n'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I\r\nhave fought with the men, I will be cruel with the\r\nmaids, and cut off their heads.\r\nGREGORY\r\nThe heads of the maids?

[Whatever, Sampson.]
SAMPSON\r\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;\r\ntake it in what sense thou wilt.\r\nGREGORY\r\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and\r\n'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

[It's on!]
GREGORY\r\n'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou\r\nhadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes\r\ntwo of the house of the Montagues.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\r\nGREGORY\r\nHow! turn thy back and run?

[Watch Your Back.]
SAMPSON\r\nFear me not.\r\nGREGORY\r\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\r\nSAMPSON\r\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

[Act 1, Scene 1]
GREGORY\r\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as\r\nthey list.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;\r\nwhich is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

[You are 1/5th there.  Go get some water and stretch your fingers. Hurry up you don't want to miss anything.]

[Don't bite your thumb]
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR\r\nABRAHAM\r\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\r\nSAMPSON\r\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\r\nABRAHAM\r\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?

[Someone isn't telling the truth.]
SAMPSON\r\n[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I\r\nsay ay?\r\nGREGORY\r\nNo.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nNo, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I\r\nbite my thumb, sir.

[Act 1, Scene 1 ]
GREGORY\r\nDo you quarrel, sir?\r\nABRAHAM\r\nQuarrel sir! no, sir.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nIf you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a\r\nman as you.\r\nABRAHAM\r\nNo better.

[Act 1, Scene 1]
SAMPSON\r\nWell, sir.\r\nGREGORY\r\nSay 'better:' here comes one of my master's\r\nkinsmen.\r\nSAMPSON\r\nYes, better, sir.\r\nABRAHAM\r\nYou lie.

[Do I need to buy a sword?]
SAMPSON\r\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy\r\nswashing blow.\r\nThey fight\r\nEnter BENVOLIO\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nPart, fools!\r\nPut up your swords; you know not what you do.\r\nBeats down their swords

[Who is this guy?]
Enter TYBALT\r\nTYBALT\r\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\r\nTurn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nI do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,\r\nOr manage it to part these men with me.

[Get Ready to Rumble.]
TYBALT\r\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,\r\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\r\nHave at thee, coward!\r\nThey fight

[These guys are nuts.]
Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;\r\nthen enter Citizens, with clubs\r\nFirst Citizen \r\nClubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them\r\ndown! Down with the Capulets! down with the\r\nMontagues!

[Act 1, Scene 1]
Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET\r\nCAPULET\r\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\r\nLADY CAPULET\r\nA crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

[Stand up and stretch out!]

[Yikes!]

CAPULET\r\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\r\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\r\nEnter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE\r\nMONTAGUE\r\nThou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.\r\nLADY MONTAGUE\r\nThou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

[Act 1, Scene 1]
Enter PRINCE, with Attendants\r\nPRINCE\r\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\r\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--\r\nWill they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\r\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\r\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\r\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands

Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,\r\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\r\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\r\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\r\nHave thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,\r\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\r\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\r\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,

[Stay with it.]
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:\r\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\r\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\r\nFor this time, all the rest depart away:\r\nYou Capulet; shall go along with me:\r\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon,\r\nTo know our further pleasure in this case,\r\nTo old Free-town, our common judgment-place.

Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\r\nExeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nMONTAGUE\r\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\r\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO\r\nHere were the servants of your adversary,\r\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach:\r\nI drew to part them: in the instant came\r\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,\r\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\r\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds,\r\nWho nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:

While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\r\nCame more and more and fought on part and part,\r\nTill the prince came, who parted either part.\r\nLADY MONTAGUE\r\nO, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?\r\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO\r\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\r\nPeer'd forth the golden window of the east,\r\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\r\nWhere, underneath the grove of sycamore\r\nThat westward rooteth from the city's side,\r\nSo early walking did I see your son:\r\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me

[You've got 55 seconds this time!]
And stole into the covert of the wood:\r\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\r\nThat most are busied when they're most alone,\r\nPursued my humour not pursuing his,\r\nAnd gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE\r\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\r\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.\r\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\r\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\r\nShould in the furthest east begin to draw\r\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\r\nAway from the light steals home my heavy son,

[ht: Work hard, play hard!]

[You got it going on!]
And private in his chamber pens himself,\r\nShuts up his windows, locks far daylight out\r\nAnd makes himself an artificial night:\r\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\r\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?

[Act 1, Scene 1]
MONTAGUE\r\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nHave you importuned him by any means?

[Act 1, Scene 1]
MONTAGUE\r\nBoth by myself and many other friends:\r\nBut he, his own affections' counsellor,\r\nIs to himself--I will not say how true--\r\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\r\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\r\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm,\r\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,

Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\r\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.\r\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\r\nEnter ROMEO\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nSee, where he comes: so please you, step aside;\r\nI'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE\r\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay,\r\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.\r\nExeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nGood-morrow, cousin.\r\nROMEO\r\nIs the day so young?

BENVOLIO\r\nBut new struck nine.\r\nROMEO \r\nAy me! sad hours seem long.\r\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO\r\nNot having that, which, having, makes them short.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nIn love?\r\nROMEO\r\nOut--\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nOf love?

[He like her!]
ROMEO
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
BENVOLIO
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

[Look out!  You've got 60 seconds!]
ROMEO\r\nAlas, that love, whose view is muffled still,\r\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\r\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\r\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\r\nHere's much to do with hate, but more with love.\r\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\r\nO any thing, of nothing first create!

O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\r\nMis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\r\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,\r\nsick health!\r\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\r\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\r\nDost thou not laugh?

[You've almost typed the entire Act1, Scene1 of Romeo and Juliet.  Could you imaging typing the ENTIRE works of Shakespeare!]

BENVOLIO
No, coz, I rather weep.
ROMEO
Good heart, at what?
BENVOLIO
At thy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;

Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:\r\nWhat is it else? a madness most discreet,\r\nA choking gall and a preserving sweet.\r\nFarewell, my coz.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nSoft! I will go along;\r\nAn if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO\r\nTut, I have lost myself; I am not here;\r\nThis is not Romeo, he's some other where.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nTell me in sadness, who is that you love.\r\nROMEO\r\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?


BENVOLIO\r\nGroan! why, no.\r\nBut sadly tell me who.\r\nROMEO\r\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will:\r\nAh, word ill urged to one that is so ill!\r\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO\r\nI aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.\r\nROMEO\r\nA right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO\r\nWell, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit\r\nWith Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;\r\nAnd, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\r\nFrom love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\r\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\r\nNor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,\r\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:

O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,\r\nThat when she dies with beauty dies her store.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live\r\nchaste?

[Ok, 55 seconds for this exercise.]
ROMEO\r\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,\r\nFor beauty starved with her severity\r\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\r\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\r\nTo merit bliss by making me despair:\r\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\r\nDo I live dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO\r\nBe ruled by me, forget to think of her.\r\nROMEO\r\nO, teach me how I should forget to think.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\r\nExamine other beauties.
[You are amazing!]

[Act 1, Scene 1]
ROMEO
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:\r\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows\r\nBeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;\r\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\r\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:\r\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,

What doth her beauty serve, but as a note\r\nWhere I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\r\nFarewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.\r\nBENVOLIO\r\nI'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\r\nExeunt
